The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
A watched pot never boils.
Actions speak louder than words.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Fortune favors the bold.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
The early bird catches the worm.
Practice makes perfect.
"When it rains, it pours."
Beggars can't be choosers.
Don't judge a book by its cover.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
All that glitters is not gold.
"Where there's smoke, there's fire."
Better late than never.
